      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This platform connects people who love dogs with friendly dog owners willing to share fun moments — like walks, playtime, or just hanging out. No pet-sitting or adoption — just shared joy. In the future, owners will be rewarded, and part of the membership will support dogs in shelters.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone who loves dogs but doesn't have one and would like to spend time with them</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Shared Paws is a platform that connects dog owners with people who love dogs but don't have one. It's all about sharing the joy of spending time with dogs, whether it's for a walk, playtime, or just hanging out. The goal is to create a community where dog lovers can enjoy the company of dogs without the responsibilities of ownership.
        Bringing Dog Owners and Lovers Together.

        Are you a OWNER or a PET FRIEND?
        Pet Friend
        Have you ever wished you could spend some time with a furry friend but did not have the time, money, or enough space to care for one? If so, we know how you feel and that’s why we created a place where you and dog owners can connect and share what we all love: pets.
        Pet Owner
        Our pets have their own feelings and need as much care and attention as any person would. Perhaps you want to give your pet some social time — to help your buddy develop better social skills, to have that first contact with kids, to provide extra playtime, to develop new friendships, or even just to see the smile on other people's faces. If any of those apply, you are in the right place.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Davi Freitas. I’m from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and in 2025 I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, to study at BYU-Idaho.
        Back in Brazil, I was blessed to share my life with several dogs who filled my days with love and companionship. One of my greatest companions was Kinder — she was full of energy, very playful, and loved playing tag. When I moved to the United States, my busy life didn’t allow me to care for a pet, and I deeply missed Kinder and my other best friend, Mile. This longing inspired me to create this site — a place where people who love animals can connect, share moments of joy and affection, and experience the special friendship between humans and their four-legged friends. Because no matter how busy life gets, the love for pets should never fade.
